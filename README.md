# QMBT_copter
A simple, yet versatile quadcopter controller and code. Based on the Arduino platform using the Atmega328p and MPU6050.

This project has a few milestones that are set on its path. 
1. Create a versatile PCB which will overcome the common problems such as power distribution. 
2. Create lightweight code that will be self sufficient, aka, no external program will be needed for changing settings of the quadcopter, except for a terminal window. 
3. Ultimate goal is to have full support of peripheral devices such as a sonic distance sensor to help aid in obstacle avoidance, or a GPS unit for man-less operation. 

This is just the beginning of the project, though experimentation with the PCB have been conducted for a while now. At this point, the project is reset to a fresh start.
